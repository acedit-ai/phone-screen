# AI Phone Screen Documentation

This directory contains the Docusaurus documentation site for the AI Phone Screen project.

## 🔗 Complete Isolation

This documentation folder is **completely independent** and can be removed without affecting the main webapp.

## Development

```bash
cd documentation
npm install
npm start
```

The documentation site will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

## Configuration

The site is configured for **subpath hosting** at `/documentation/`:

- **Base URL**: `/documentation/`
- **Production URL**: `https://phone-screen.acedit.ai/documentation/`
- **Blog**: Disabled (as requested)
- **Docs Route**: Served at root of `/documentation/` (not `/documentation/docs/`)

## Scripts

- `npm start` - Start development server on port 3001
- `npm run build` - Build static files for production (configured for `/documentation/` subpath)
- **`npm run build-and-copy`** - Build docs and copy to webapp's public folder
- **`npm run test-integration`** - Test that documentation works in webapp (requires webapp running)
- `npm run serve` - Serve built files locally to test production build
- `npm run clear` - Clear Docusaurus cache

## Build & Copy Process

The **Phase 3** integration process:

1. **`npm run build-and-copy`** - Automatically builds and copies documentation to webapp
2. Static files are placed in `webapp/public/documentation/`
3. Next.js serves them at `http://localhost:3000/documentation/`
4. **`npm run test-integration`** - Verifies integration is working

### Graceful Fallbacks

- If `webapp/` directory doesn't exist, the script gracefully skips copying
- Documentation can always be built and served independently
- Perfect for contributors who only want to work on docs

## Next.js Integration (Phase 4)

The webapp now includes **complete Next.js integration**:

### 🔧 Routing Configuration
- **Clean URLs**: `/documentation/intro` works (no need for `.html`)
- **Rewrites**: Automatic serving of `index.html` files for directory routes
- **Redirects**: `/docs` → `/documentation` for consistency

### 🧭 Navigation Integration
- **Documentation link** added to main webapp navigation
- **BookOpen icon** with "Docs" label in top bar
- **Responsive design** - icon only on mobile, text on desktop

### 🧪 Testing
- Enhanced integration tests cover all routing scenarios
- Tests clean URLs, redirects, and content verification
- Run with: `npm run test-integration`

## Enhanced Documentation (Phase 5)

**Phase 5** delivers **world-class documentation experience**:

### 📝 Comprehensive Content
- **Quick Start Guide** - 10-minute setup with step-by-step instructions
- **Customization Guide** - AI prompts, branding, integrations, scaling
- **Deployment Guide** - Production deployment with Vercel, Railway, monitoring
- **Troubleshooting Guide** - Common issues, debugging, community support

### 🎨 Professional Design
- **Enhanced Homepage** - Engaging landing page with clear CTAs
- **Custom Navigation** - "Back to App" button for seamless movement
- **Professional Footer** - Organized links to resources and community
- **Visual Polish** - Card layouts, proper spacing, emoji-enhanced headings

### 🧭 Perfect User Journey
1. Click "Docs" in main webapp → Land on documentation homepage
2. Follow Quick Start → Get running in 10 minutes
3. Customize as needed → Deploy to production
4. Get support → Return to main app

## Integration Status

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Basic Docusaurus setup 
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Configure for `/documentation` subpath
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Build & copy mechanism
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Webapp integration & routing
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Navigation & polish (COMPLETE)

## Production Ready! 🚀

The documentation system is now **fully production-ready** with:

✅ **Complete documentation suite** covering all aspects  
✅ **Professional design** that reflects well on the project  
✅ **Seamless integration** with the main webapp  
✅ **Mobile responsive** design for all devices  
✅ **SEO optimized** with proper meta tags and structure  
✅ **Fast loading** static site with efficient routing  
✅ **Self-service** capability for developer onboarding  

## Removal Instructions

To completely remove documentation from this project:

1. Delete this entire `/documentation` directory
2. Delete `webapp/public/documentation/` (if it exists)
3. Remove documentation routes from `webapp/next.config.mjs`:
   ```javascript
   // Remove all /documentation routes from rewrites and redirects
   ```
4. Remove documentation link from `webapp/components/top-bar.tsx`:
   ```jsx
   // Remove the "Docs" link and BookOpen icon
   ```

That's it! The webapp will continue working perfectly without this documentation.

## Ready for Launch! 🎉

The AI Phone Screen documentation is now ready for:
- **Public launch** and open source promotion
- **Developer onboarding** at scale  
- **Community growth** with proper support channels
- **Production deployments** with confidence
